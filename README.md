this is a modied version of https://github.com/DEFHerobrine/Password-Extraction-To-Discord-Flipper-BadUSB

tested on windows 11.

 - Script sends all saved passwords to a discord webhook

    HOW TO:
1. Create discord webhook.
2. Replace "YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK" with your discord webhook.
3. Save and move it to your flipper.

The original script did not run on windows 11 for me, so I modified it.
